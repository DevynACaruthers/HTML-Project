                    <h1>The Introduction</h1>
                    Hello dear viewer and/or patron of our company! We are excited to introduce this new and improved webpage for Soundbreaker Entertainment, showcasing our up-and-coming games
            
                    (and possible teasers) along with information about the company! Although we may be an indie studio we will make sure to produce quality games and projects to rival that of
            
                    AAA gaming corperations. 
            
                    <Br>
            
                        <h1>The Beginning</h1>
            
                        Sounbreaker studio started with the creator of the company: Devyn Caruthers. It was his vision to pioneer a world where people aren't anchored down by constrictive
            
                        contracts put in place to limit the creative freedom of animators, scriptwriters, and developers. He wanted to help make his dream a reality by creating a safe haven 
            
                        for creators to make whatever their heart desires, along with not being hindered by what was popular at the time or follow trends but create something truly timeless.
            
                        His first game was a snake game he may or may not have copied the majority of from his coding teacher, designed for a competition for one of his clubs. Unfortunately, it
                        
                        failed and acted more as a lesson then it's original purpose of being fun.
            
                        <h2>Future Projects</h2>
            
                        The first game planning to be made by the studio is a parody of CS:GO currently without a title, taking place in an office setting where people use typical office supplies
            
                        as weapons while planting a calculator "bomb" at the targetted location. However, it would not be that simple since we were also inspired by games like "Valorant" and
            
                        "Rainbow Six: Siege" by adding characters with unique abilites! This would drastically change combat and make it more strategic and engaging to the general audience,
            
                        not to mention let the team have fun with designing a bunch of different characters, (It won't be). We have others, but the ideas will have to develop more so stay tuned!
                </p>
